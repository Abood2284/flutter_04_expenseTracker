# How a new Flutter Dev can benifit

This app was created for educational and learning purposes it has all the basics a flutter beginner will needs in it journey.
With that said it also has docs commenting explaining the hard and important concept of Flutter & Dart with that it also gives you an idea of how the data is passed in the flutter app

# What I learned from this Module

### Flutter Fundamentals

- Compose UI from built-in and custom Widgets
- Custom Widgets are also composed from built-in and other custom Widgets
- Style and configure via arguments
- Use the Docs & IDE support!

### Styling and configuring Widgets

- Styling & Layout options are very different: EdgeInsets.all(), BoxDecoration(), enums, .... Docs + IDE support help you
- Often, there's more than one Widget or option to get the job done

### Theming

- Define a Global theme for colors and text to then tap into it from anywhere in the app via Theme.of(context)
- Built-in Widgets use theme settings automatically

### Business Logic

- Lift state up and use stateful Widgets only when needed
- Pass functions references and data around
- Adjust the UI to your logic
